        <h3>Stay Active, Stay Healthy!</h3>
        <p>Physical activity offers numerous benefits for health and well-being, particularly for individuals managing diabetes or other health conditions.
            Regular exercise helps regulate blood sugar levels by improving insulin sensitivity and enhancing glucose uptake by muscles. It also promotes cardiovascular health,
            reduces the risk of complications, and supports weight management. Beyond physical health, activity boosts mental well-being by reducing stress, improving mood, and enhancing sleep quality.
            For those with chronic conditions, tailored physical activity can improve mobility, reduce pain,
            and foster independence, contributing to a better overall quality of life.
